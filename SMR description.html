With this mod you can select a recipe from a machine and replicate it along multiple machines. You can also aim to a manufacturer and
check wich recipe it currently has defined.

<h3>How to use it:</h3>
Build the tool at the Workbench and with that you can:
<ul>
	<li>See the recipe defined at the machine you are aiming;</li>
	<li>Select a recipe from a machine by clicking on it while holding Left Ctrl;</li>
	<li>Define a selected recipe into new machines that can accept it, by clicking while aiming on it.
        The tool will glow green if the recipe can be defined on the machine; red if not. It will be off if
        the machine does not use recipes or already has the same recipe defined;</li>
</ul>
